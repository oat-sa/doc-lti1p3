## Concepts

You can find below the implementations of the main concepts of the [LTI 1.3 Core](http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3) specification.

###  Platforms, tools and registrations

- [Platform](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Platform/PlatformInterface.php): any kind of platform that needs to delegate bits of functionality out to a suite of tools.
- [Tool](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Tool/ToolInterface.php): external application or service providing functionality to a platform.
- [Registration](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Registration/RegistrationInterface.php): defines the scope of contexts under which a tool is made available for a platform.

### Messages

Messages represent integration between platforms and tools intermediated by a user's browser.

- [LTI Message](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Message/LtiMessageInterface.php): reference to an exchange between platforms and tools in message based communications.
- [LTI Message Payload](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Message/Payload/LtiMessagePayloadInterface.php): reference to the payload (JWT) of an exchange between platforms and tools in message based communications, containing LTI claims.
- [LTI Resource Link](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Resource/LtiResourceLink/LtiResourceLinkInterface.php): reference to a resource made available from a tool for a platform.
- [LTI Resource Link Launch](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Message/Launch/Builder/LtiResourceLinkLaunchRequestBuilder.php): refers to the process in which a user interacts with an LTI Resource Link within the platform and is subsequently "launched" into a tool.

### Services

Services represent direct connections between platforms and tools (without involving user's browser).

- [Server](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Service/Server): server side of LTI service
- [Client](https://github.com/oat-sa/lib-lti1p3-core/blob/master/src/Service/Client): client side of LTI service
